# Getting started
This app is built with Grunt and Apache Cordova. All necessary depencies could be received by using npm.

## Build steps
To build the messenger app you have to execute three simple steps:

1. Execute npm to get all dependencies:
    ```shell
    npm install
    ```
2. Run grunt to built the source code:

    grunt default
    ```
3. Create an Apache Cordova app (e.g. for Android):
    ```shell
    cordova run android
    ```
